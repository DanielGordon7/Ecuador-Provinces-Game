# Ecuador-Provinces-Game
Interactive game for guessing the provinces of Ecuador. 

In order to play you just need to run the main.py file. This will show you a map of Ecuador, and you will be prompted to type the name of a province, any province.
If you get it right, the name will appear on top of the corresponding province, and your score will be visibly tracked. There are no penalties for guessing wrong.

You can also type 'exit' to end the game at any time, upong which you will get a list of all the provinces that you missed.

This simple game was built using Python's built-in turtle module, as well as the pandas library.

Have fun!
